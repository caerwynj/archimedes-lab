Static site generation using m4 and make
and other standard POSIX tools.
Based on markdown it can output to docs/ folder
for render by github pages.
Can also output to html _site folder.

Content is written in markdown .md.m4
then converted to .html.m4
then converted to .html
templates are in .html

Uses templates inspired my jekyll minima.
