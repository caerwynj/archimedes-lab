The post bundle file gets split into meta and body and src listing.

Metadata gets parsed by awk and turned into m4 macros.
Then m4 turns a post into HTML.
A post has meta, the main text, and the source code listing.

The main text body is supposed to be markdown but there
is issue with mixing in MathJax.

The source code listing is run on arcem to 
generate output listing from running the BBC Basic
source.
Then the output is run through awk to output an HTML table.

I need to generate a URL from the post filename.
Or a naming convention for posts.

I'd like to combine the meta and post into one file.
Bundle files with '---' as separator.
